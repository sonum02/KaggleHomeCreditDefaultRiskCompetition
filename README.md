# KaggleHomeCreditDefaultRiskCompetition
This repo houses the code for my attempt to Kaggle competition 
"Houme Credit Default Risk" here - https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk. 

Problem Statement: We need to predict their clients' repayment abilities to improve client experience. The project will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

I have used various classification algorithms to predict the result:
1. Logistic regression
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Kernel SVM

And used confusion matrix to see which algorithm performed better.
